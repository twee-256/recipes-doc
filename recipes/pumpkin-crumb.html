    </ul>

    <h4>Maple Icing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (80g/ml) pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 cup (112g) sifted confectioners sugar</li>
        <li>pinch salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Blot the pumpkin: Line a medium bowl with several paper towels. Place the pumpkin puree in the bowl. Using
            another
            paper towel, press down to blot excess moisture out of the pumpkin. Repeat with new paper towels until the
            pumpkin
            feels much drier and has been reduced by half, to 1/2 cup (113g). Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the cookies: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and
            salt.
            Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and maple syrup until
            combined.
            Whisk in the egg yolk and vanilla extract until incorporated, then whisk in the 1/2 cup of blotted pumpkin.
            Pour
            the
            dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon until combined.
            The
            cookie dough will be very soft.
        </li>
        <li>Cover tightly and refrigerate the cookie dough for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>
            Make the crumb topping: Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie
            spice.
            Using a fork or a handheld mixer on low speed, mix in the butter until sandy and crumbly.
            Feel free to work the mixture together with your hands if it’s not coming together. Place the topping in the
            refrigerator or freezer until needed in step 7.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scoop and roll the chilled cookie dough into balls, about 1.5 Tbsp (35g) of dough each, and arrange 3 inches
            apart
            on the prepared baking sheets. Use your thumb to press a few indents into the middle of each cookie, to make
            a
            shallow bowl shape. Sprinkle a generous amount of the cold crumb topping on top of each cookie.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 14–15 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are lightly browned and set. Cool the cookies on
            the
            baking
            sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the icing: In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter and maple syrup together, whisking
            occasionally.
            Once the butter has melted, remove from heat and whisk in the sifted confectioners’ sugar. Taste. Add a
            pinch of
            salt, if desired. Drizzle over cookies. Icing will set after about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days, or in the refrigerator for up
            to 1
            week.
        </li>
    </ol>
