        <li>1 and 2/3 cups (209g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons store-bought or homemade pumpkin pie spice*</li>
        <li>1 cup (16 Tbsp; 226g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <li>8 ounces (226g) full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (4 Tbsp; 56g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups (180g) confectioners’ sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon store-bought or homemade pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>pinch of salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Blot the pumpkin: Line a medium bowl with 2 paper towels. Place the pumpkin puree in the bowl. Using another
            paper towel, press down to blot excess moisture out of the pumpkin. After blotting, make sure you have about
            3/4 cup (170g) of pumpkin. Discard paper towels and set blotted pumpkin aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set
            aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, whisk the oats, flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and both
            sugars together on medium-high speed until creamed, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as
            needed. Add the egg yolk
            and vanilla extract and beat on high speed until combined. Add the blotted pumpkin, and beat on high speed
            until combined.</li>
        <li>
            Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until incorporated, then increase to
            medium speed and beat until combined. Dough will be creamy, soft, and sticky.
        </li>
        <li>Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop cookie dough (about a scant 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons (25–30g) of dough each)
            and drop on the cookie sheet, about 3 inches apart. With the back of a spoon, press down to slightly flatten
            the balls, as the cookies won’t spread much unless you help out first.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 14–16 minutes or until lightly browned and set on the edges. Remove from the oven and allow cookies
            to cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. (Success
            Tip: If your cookies are spreading unevenly, remove them from the oven and use a spoon to lightly push any
            wonky edges back in towards the center, to reshape into circles. You can repeat this trick again, if needed,
            when you take them out of the oven after baking.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat cream
            cheese and butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners’ sugar,
            pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, and salt. Beat on low speed until confectioners’ sugar is incorporated, then
            increase to high speed and beat until smooth and creamy. Pipe or spread some of the filling on the bottom
            side of half of the cooled cookies; top with remaining cookies, right side up. I used Wilton 2A tip to pipe.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and store leftover cookies at room temperature for up to 1 day. After that, store in the refrigerator
            for up to 1 week to keep the creamy filling fresh.
