    <img src="/easy-baked-pumpkin-donuts.jpg" width="200" height="300">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked donuts (not fried!) and topped with a rich brown sugar icing, they’re soft, moist, perfectly spiced, and
        ready in under 45 minutes. The icing sets beautifully so the donuts are easy to stack, store, and even
        transport—making
        them just as practical as they are delicious!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 3/4 cups (219g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon store-bought or homemade pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil (or canola oil or melted coconut oil)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup (226g) fresh or canned pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (80ml) milk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Brown Sugar Icing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) milk (whole milk is best)</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon (14g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups (170g) sifted confectioners’ sugar</li>
        <li>pinch of salt, to taste</li>
        <li>optional topping: crushed walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease donut pan(s) with nonstick spray. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the donuts: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and
            pumpkin pie spice until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the oil, brown sugar, eggs, pumpkin puree, milk, and vanilla extract until
            combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk together gently just until combined
            and no flour pockets remain. Do not over-mix.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into the donut cavities or, for ease, I recommend transferring the batter into a large
            zipped-top bag. Cut a corner off the bottom of the bag and pipe the batter into each donut cavity, filling
            each about halfway.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10–11 minutes or until the edges and tops are lightly browned. To test, poke your finger into the
            top of the donut. If the donut bounces back, they’re done.</li>
        <li> Cool donuts in the pan for 2 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack. Re-grease the pan and bake the
            remaining donut batter. *For mini donuts, bake in a mini donut pan for 8–9 minutes. Cool donuts for at least
            10 minutes before icing them.*</li>
        <li>Make the icing: Combine the brown sugar, milk, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until
            the butter has melted and the mixture is smooth. Bring to a simmer. Allow to simmer for 1 minute, then
            remove from heat and whisk in the vanilla extract and sifted confectioners’ sugar until smooth and combined.
            Taste, then add a pinch of salt if desired—I always add a tiny pinch. Let the icing cool for 5 minutes to
            slightly thicken.</li>
        <li>Dip the tops of the pumpkin donuts into the warm icing. If the icing is getting too thick as you’re dipping,
            whisk in a little more milk, or warm back up in the microwave or on the stove to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Place dipped donuts on a cooling rack placed on a baking sheet to allow excess icing to drip off. Top with
            chopped nuts or other toppings if desired. If applied lightly, the icing will eventually set (in about 1
            hour) so you can stack or transport the donuts.</li>
        <li>Cover leftover donuts tightly and store at room temperature for 1–2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1
            week.</li>
    </ol>
